# sudoku_solver
A C++ program that solves sudoku puzzles. Sample inputs are shown in the text files. User must manually type in file name in main.cpp for now.


CHANGES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/22 - Should now be able to solve all puzzles, including the infamous Inkala test. Takes several hours for the Inkala test, however.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently the program is slow for complex puzzles (e.g. Inkala test). I have several ideas to improve speed.
- Be able to handle multiple user inputs.
- Clean code to make it more readable.
